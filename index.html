        <h3 id="principle">Principle</h3>
        <p>
          Leave No Trace is arguably our most cherished and tangible principle.
          Our community respects the environment. We are committed to leaving no
          physical trace of our activities wherever we gather. We clean up after
          ourselves and endeavor, whenever possible, to leave such places in a
          better state than when we found them. Each participant must remove all
          items they brought with them – including their trash and all the tiny
          bits of things that humans tend to shed – when they leave the site.
        </p>
        <h3 id="recyclable">Is this Recyclable?</h3>
        <p>
          Currently, in NOLA you can recycle plastic #1 (PETE), plastic #2
          (HDPE), clean (not bright colored) paper and cardboard, glass, metal,
          batteries.
        </p>
        <p>
          Make sure you thoroughly clean plastic out - one drop of oil and whole
          batch becomes unrecyclable.
        </p>
        <p>
          If paper or cardboard is stained with food - it's not longer
          recyclable, but you can still compost it.
        </p>
        <h3 id="compostable">Is this Compostable?</h3>
        <p>
          Any organic material is compostable. However, NOLA currently doesn't
          support extensive composting. If you want to compost at Compost Now
          locations, make sure your compost bag doesn't have meat, bones, dairy,
          oil.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you compost at home or want to start composting in your yard - you
          can compost everything: from meat to your nail clippings.
        </p>
